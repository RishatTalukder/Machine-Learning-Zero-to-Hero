    "# A little Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous article, I gave you small introduction of `machine learning` and what steps every machine learning model goes through and in this article we will go through the steps to build a `linear regression` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the `DATA`.\n",
    "    - Define the `features` and the `target`.\n",
    "2. Prepare/clean the `data`.\n",
    "3. Split the `data` into `train` and `test` sets.\n",
    "4. Train the `model`.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the `model`.\n",
    "6. Make `predictions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the first step is to get the data and as this is the `first algorithm` of `machine learning`, I want to keep it simple and talk more about the algorithm and less about cleaning the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I want to introduce you to a website called [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) which is a great place to get data for `machine learning` and `data science` projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can find real, non-real, artificial, non-aritificial, man made, woman made, child made, computer made data for `machine learning` and `data science` projects. Also, you can do competitions and make friend and also code with your friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This website is amazing and the more you spend time on this site the more you get amazed how much a website can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I found a dataset called [house prices in bangladesh](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/durjoychandrapaul/house-price-bangladesh/data). I don't know if it's real or not. But we can practice some model training with this dataset. You can either download the data from my github repo or you can download it from kaggle yourself(I recommend you download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/durjoychandrapaul/house-price-bangladesh/data)).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's see the data."
