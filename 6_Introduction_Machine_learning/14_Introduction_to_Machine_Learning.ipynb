    "In this article I'll be going over the basic concepts of `machine learning` and steps to build a `machine learning` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Machine learning is the process of teaching a computer to learn from data without being explicitly programmed to do so._\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is emphasized here is that the computer is learning from the `data` itself and not from program made by a human. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, data is the key of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give computer some data(a huge amount of data) and it should be able to learn the patterns from it and make `predictions` that are close to if not exactly the same as the human made predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a mathematical process of simulating how a human brain works and how a computer works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can be categorized into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditinal ML algorithms are `supervised learning` algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is the process where you have `labeled data` and the task for the computer is to learn the patterns from the data and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every dataset should have a `target` or `output` column and the data inside that should be `labeled`. Like, a person's age, height, weight, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the term `AI` comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning model that does not have `labeled data` and figures out the patterns from the data itself is called `unsupervised learning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Agents` like `gpt, gemini, claude` etc. learns patterns from the data itself and makes predictions. Even though I like to call these `psuedo AI` they are very close to the real `AI` and are just a simulation of a `AI` trained on a `large dataset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Machine Learning Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a `cycle` of learning and then using the model to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather a large amount of data to train the model on.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing/Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training.\n",
    "3. **Splitting the Data**: Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "4. **Training the Model**: Train the machine learning model on the training data.\n",
    "5. **Evaluating the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.\n",
    "6. **Making Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the steps every machine learning model goes through. It is a cycle of learning and then using the model to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk more in depth about the steps of the machine learning lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we gather a large amount of data to train the model on. The data can be in the form of text, images, audio, video, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step we also have to figure out what we are trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to collect data that has a `target` or `output` that should be labeled as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing/Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to `clean` and `preprocess` the data to make it suitable for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This where our data analysis and visualization comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use our knowledge to make the data cleaner and more suitable for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also this is the most lengthy step of the machine learning lifecycle. Because if you don't analyze the data well, you might end up with a dataset that has a imbalanced distribution of the data and can cause `overfitting` or `underfitting` or `bias` in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I'll talk about overfitting and underfitting as we progress through this article series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Splitting the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to `split` the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we use all our data into training a ML model, what do we use to evaluate the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need some input data so that we can test the model on data that the model has never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we can have a proper evaluation of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we must split the data into `training` and `testing` sets. Sometimes, we might split the data into `training`, `validation` and `testing` sets. Te validation set comes in hands when we want to check the performance of the model on data that the model has never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In neural networks we use `validation` set to check the learning progress and `testing` set to check the final performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to `train` the machine learning model on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the magic happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a model that is suitable for our problem and train it on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of models available in `scikit-learn` and `tensorflow` that we can choose from and also there are multiple algorithms to solve the same problem but can have different performance on different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model is trained, we need to `evaluate` the model's performance on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be two types of evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**\n",
    "- **Loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll talk more about this later on this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a trained model, we can use it to make predictions on new data. If the performance of the model is a satisfactory, we can use it to make predictions on new data and use the predictions to make decisions or take actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluating a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a model is `comparing` the prediction of the model with the actual output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a dataset like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input | Output |\n",
    "|-------|--------|\n",
    "| 1     | x      |\n",
    "| 2     | y      |\n",
    "| 3     | x      |\n",
    "| 4     | x      |\n",
    "| 5     | x      |\n",
    "| 6     | y      |\n",
    "| 7     | x      |\n",
    "| 8     | y      |\n",
    "| 9     | y      |\n",
    "| 10    | x      |\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can see that the data is labels with `x` and `y`. Only two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we have a model that predicts the output based on the input. Let's say the model predicts the output like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input | Prediction |\n",
    "|-------|------------|\n",
    "| 1     | x          |\n",
    "| 2     | y          |\n",
    "| 3     | x          |\n",
    "| 4     | y  (wrong)       |\n",
    "| 5     | x          |\n",
    "| 6     | x   (wrong)       |\n",
    "| 7     | x          |\n",
    "| 8     | y          |\n",
    "| 9     | y          |\n",
    "| 10    | x          |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, If we compare the prediction of the model with the actual output, we can get the accuracy of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "|Actual Output|Prediction|\n",
    "|-------------|----------|\n",
    "|x            |x         |\n",
    "|y            |y         |\n",
    "|x            |x         |\n",
    "|x            |y         |\n",
    "|x            |x         |\n",
    "|x            |x         |\n",
    "|x            |x         |\n",
    "|y            |y         |\n",
    "|y            |y         |\n",
    "|x            |x         |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can clearly see that out of 10 predictions, 8 are correct and 2 are incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the accuracy of the model is $\\frac{number\\ of\\ correct\\ predictions}{total\\ number\\ of\\ predictions}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the accuracy of the model is $\\frac{8}{10} = 0.8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the accuracy of the model is 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is good. But this doesn't give us the whole picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a thought experiment. Let's say you have a data set with 100 samples(rows) and in the input you have two classes. 1. x and 2. y.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you have only two classes in a data set, it is refered to as `binary classification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, In the target class let's say you have `99 x` and only `1 y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say you have a model that is trained on this data and predicts the output. And it gives you a output of `100 x`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you have only one wrong prediction. So, the accuracy should be $\\frac{99}{100} = 0.99$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the accuracy of the model is 99%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is amazing right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nope, it is not. What do you think will happend you test the model with unseen data that was not part of the training data and has only `y` class. Do you think the model can predict the `y` class correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course not, This is a classic example of `overfitting` or `bias` in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to remember this with a analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "_You learned to ride a bicycle so well you cannot ride a motorcycle._\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be caused by different reasons. One of them in imbalanced data like the thought experiment above.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the point is that even though you models accuracy is 99%, it is not a good model and will not perform well on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we need other way to measure the performance of a model and that's when metrics come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Accuracy.`\n",
    "- `Precision.`\n",
    "- `Recall.`\n",
    "- `F1 score.`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the metrics that will help us understand our model performance better.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's talk about them one by one."
