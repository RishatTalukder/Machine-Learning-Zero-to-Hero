    "\n",
    "`Seaborn` is a statistical plotting library in python. It is built upon `Matplotlib` and has a lot of customization options. I'll try to cover all the things I know about it. You can also find a small introduction to `matplotlib` in this `repository`.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`Seaborn` is my favorite library for `data visualization`. It is a very powerful tool that can create visually stunning plots in a single command and it's much faster to code in. YOu can go to the official [website](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) to learn more about it. There are a lot of modules built into `seaborn` and I'll try to go over those one by one."
